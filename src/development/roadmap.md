# Roadmap

This page shows the future development roadmap of the framework.

## Time Table

Planned development and the release of new chart types:

* **October 2020** - Bar chart & Column chart.

* **November 2020** - Line Chart.

* **December 2020** - Pie chart & Donut chart.

* **2021** - Polar Chart.

* **2021** - Radar Chart.

## Long Term Roadmap

The framework should implement new features and components. Not necessarily in that order, the long term goals are:

* **More Chart types** - Add more chart types, start with line chart and pie chart.

* **Secondary Axis Labels** - Currently only primary-labels are supported. Ass secondary-labels too.

* **Dual Axes Labels** - Support two independent secondary-labels, one dataset on each side of the chart.

* **Axis Title** - Support axes titles. Primary axis title and secondary axis title.

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.

* **Responsive Control** - Support conditional display for different screen sizes. The code should look like this `sm:pie md:column xl:bar`.

* **Component Prefix** - Consider supporting component prefix: `axes:primary`, `axes:*-secondary`, `axes:data`, `labels:show`, `labels:align-end`, `labels:show` etc.
