# Roadmap

This page shows the future development roadmap of the framework.

## Time Table

Planned development and the release of new chart types:

* **October 2020** - Bar chart & Column chart.

* **November 2020** - Line Chart.

* **December 2020** - Pie chart & Donut chart.

* **2021** - Polar Chart.

## Long Term Roadmap

The framework should implement new features and components. Not necessarily in that order, the long term goals are:

* **Chart types** - Support other chart types, starting with radial charts.

* **Stacked View** - For multiple datasets, allow `stacked` view.

* **Dual-Y charts** - Support two independent Y-axes: a left axis for one dataset, and a right axis for another dataset.

* **Axis Title** - Support axis title, vertical and horizontal.

* **Table Caption** - Display table captions.

* **Build Tools** - Add more build tools.
