# Components

While designing the framework, the guiding philosophy was to break down the chart into parts and build each part individually.

With decoupled components you have more flexibility to choose where to display each components and how to style it.

## External Components

With semantic markup in mind, some components can be displayed using separate HTML tags. You are not required to display them with the chart, but if you do, you can choose where to display them.

* [Title](./title/)
* [Legend](./legend/)

## Chart Components

Chart components add visual elements to the chart itself. You can enhance the chart with simple CSS classes to add additional details to your chart.

* [Wrapper](./wrapper/)
* [Axes](./axes/)
<!-- * [Annotations](./annotations/) -->
* [Tooltips](./tooltips/)
* [Motion Effects](./motion-effects/)
* [Animations](./animations/)
