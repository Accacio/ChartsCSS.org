# Introduction

**Charts.css** is a new open source framework for data visualization. It replaces traditional JS charting libraries with a CSS framework.

> Data visualization can improve user experience as graphical representation of data is usually easier to understand.

Visualization help end-users to understand data. **Charts.css** help frontend developers to turn data into beautiful charts and graphs using simple **CSS classes**.

## How It Works

The web uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and JS for functionality. When visualizing data, we should use HTML to store the data, and CSS to style and even animate the elements.

Modern **CSS frameworks** (like bootstrap) style HTML elements using predefined CSS utility classes. While those CSS frameworks focus on layouts, **Charts.css** focus on data visualization.

With a few simple CSS classes applied on the container element you can turn your entire data table into a visually appealing chart. The framework is developer friendly making it easy to customize every element with simple CSS selectors.
